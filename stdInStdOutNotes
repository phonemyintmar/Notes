stdout ka one > so yin ae tr ka write to the file

< ka kya tok input a nay nae htae tr
lets say we want to do something from a text file 
we can pass the command and use the lesser command < and then input file
example - 
wc -w < example.txt

<< ka kya tok d lo work tl. << symbol ko yayy and then pass a name and press enter
and then you can type whatever string you want for start, that will be the input and end the input with a string you started.
that will be regarded as input 
example -
cat << EOF 
Here goes 
the input
EOF

EOF ka just example you can put whatever you want.

<<< ka kya tok single string ko pass lote tr 

echo <<< "Hello World" ae lo a di ka ka needs double quotes.




okay dr ka test 
for conditions pop 

test a = b loh yite loh ya tl 
and it will just executes. and you have to catch the exit code
exit code ka $?
so echo $? 
if 1 false 
if 0 true

or [ a = a ] ae lo yayy ll ya tl 
ngr ka tok test a = a ko po th baw kya

we can also use numbers for that like test 0 = 1
